# 🏹 Daily Placement Prep Journey

This repository is my **daily logbook** for mastering coding, core CS, and aptitude — everything required to crack **campus & off-campus placements**.

I’m following a **strict 1-day-at-a-time approach**:  
- Write code daily  
- Push it here  
- Track my growth openly

## 🌱 Why this repo?
1. To stay consistent & accountable  
2. To build a **visible timeline** of my preparation  
3. To share problems + solutions that others can also practice  
4. To show recruiters my **commitment and discipline**

## 📅 Format of Daily Upload
Each **Day-X** folder will include:  
- **Coding problems** (in multiple languages if needed)
